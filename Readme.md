# 🧬 AMP Analysis Repository

This repository contains code and resources for various parts of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) sequence analysis, including scoring matrix derivation, alignment metric computation, and benchmarking of sequence similarity metrics.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1. **AMP Scoring Matrix Derivation**
**Folder:** `derive_amp_matrix/`

This module contains code for deriving custom AMP scoring matrices.  
It produces two types of matrices:
- Based on **real AMPs only**
- Based on **all known AMPs**

**Details:**
- The module relies on the `pysum` package, using a modified version of `algorithm.py` (included in this repository). Additionally `mafft` program is used for alignment.
- The main script, `run_pipeline.py`, outputs substitution counts for the input FASTA file.
- The final steps of matrix derivation are documented in the notebook:  
  `combine_counters_and_derive_matrix.ipynb`.

### 2. **AMP Alignment Metric**
**Folder:** `amp_alignment/`

This module defines a **custom AMP alignment score** built on top of the [MMSeqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2) tool.

**Details:**
- The MMSeqs2 repository must be obtained separately.  
- Custom scoring matrices from this repository need to be substituted into MMSeqs2 to compute the custom alignment metric.

### 3. **Benchmarking and Visualization**
**Folder:** `benchmark_and_plots/`

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used to benchmark AMP similarity metrics on:
- Control datasets
- Sequences generated by different generative models

**Details:**
- The notebooks depend on the [`Seqme`](https://github.com/szczurek-lab/seqme/tree/main) package.
- They should be placed inside the `notebooks/` directory of the `seqme` repository for proper execution.
- They use metric implementations and utility functions from that package.
- Update paths in `config_paths.py`

## ⚙️ Setup Notes

- **Paths:**  
  Data paths in the scripts and notebooks may need adjustment to match your local file system. Data should be placed in the `data` directory in suitable subfolder.

- **Data Availability:**  
  All datasets used in the analysis are available at:  
  👉 [Google Drive Data Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1MIwxyMPFIw35xpiOOygoFjZr2DMtQFJZ)
